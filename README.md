# TT_Project

## Project Overview

### Application Description

This application is to allow motorcycle riders to enter into the TT races. This is a road race that happens on the Isle of Man once a year and riders need to complete an entry form for each race they would like to race in.
The entries need to be checked to meet the criteria by race management, from which they will be moved from pending to approved or rejected.

### Project Goals

* Create a user interface, database and business layer
* Business layer to include testing
* Application should handle errors and invalid inputs
* Two or more linking tables
* Clear and concise documentation of the process

#### Sprint 1 - Tuesday 1st December 2020

By the end of this sprint I aim to have a database set up and interacting with the business  layer. The business layer should have methods to perform basic CRUD operations and from this have unit tests to check these methods.

##### Sprint Goals

* [ ] Complete project board
* [ ] Update epics and user stories
* [ ] Complete user story 0.1
* [ ] complete user story 0.2
* [ ] Complete user story 0.3
* [ ] Complete Agile documentation
* [ ] Complete Agile review
* [ ] Complete Agile retrospective
* [ ] Update README file
* [ ] Commit all changes to GitHub

##### Sprint Review

The project admin was completed early in the day which left lots of time for the rest of the tasks. The database was completed with several modifications throughout the day to link the tables effectively. The interface between database and code was created as well as a business layer and tests were started however, only some were fully coded and run.

Changes were pushed to GitHub, but the commits could be improved to have smaller changes more often to make the description clearer. The commits could also link to the user stories that were completed.

##### Sprint Retrospective

* Continue: Pace, I didn't overload myself on work so I am not behind on tasks.
* Continue: I should continue with the pace of work and work load for now.
* Start: I can start timeboxing my tasks to improve my time management.
* Start: I can start committing work more often.
* Due to the data tests in the morning, sprint 1 was shorter than other days so I can add more user stories to my sprint backlog for tomorrow.

#### Sprint 2 - Wednesday 2nd December 2020

The main focus of this sprint is to create the WPF layer and add functionality to the GUI layer. This involves adding some more methods to the business layer to provide full functionality of the application. The rider profile and entry form is the main goal for the GUI today.

The only potential blocker for today is computer limitations, as it is still the early stages of creation.

##### Sprint Goals

* [ ] Complete user story 0.4
* [ ] Complete user story 1.1
* [ ] Complete user story 2.1
* [ ] Complete user story 3.1
* [ ] Complete user story 3.3
* [ ] Update README
* [ ] Complete Agile review
* [ ] Complete Agile retrospective
* [ ] Commit all changes

##### Sprint Review

Despite starting the day on track, it became clear that I needed to change some links within my database such as foreign keys. This meant I had to spend more time than planned in the morning on correcting it. When advancing from this I created more methods and tests, which once again took more time than planned.

The WPF was then started and the structure of the application was laid out as planned. From this I started on the backcode of the programme and connected the business layer and the GUI.

##### Sprint Retrospective

* Stop: I spent too long focusing on the change of data in the database and implementing testing on this.
* Start: Researching problems as I am completing them instead of stopping my work to research the problem
* Start: I learnt today to add extra time to the plan so if there are problems there is allocated time for it and if not used, this time can be spent on finer details on the planned stages.
* Continue: Pacing of work completed, I got as far as I wanted to on the WPF but not the other sections due to them being pushed back by the database update.
