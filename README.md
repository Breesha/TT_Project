# TT_Project

## Project Overview

### Application Description

This application is to allow motorcycle riders to enter into the TT races. This is a road race that happens on the Isle of Man once a year and riders need to complete an entry form for each race they would like to race in.
The entries need to be checked to meet the criteria by race management, from which they will be moved from pending to approved or rejected.

### Project Goals

* Create a user interface, database and business layer
* Business layer to include testing
* Application should handle errors and invalid inputs
* Two or more linking tables
* Clear and concise documentation of the process

##### Sprint Review

The project admin was completed early in the day which left lots of time for the rest of the tasks. The database was completed with several modifications throughout the day to link the tables effectively. The interface between database and code was created as well as a business layer and tests were started however, only some were fully coded and run.

Changes were pushed to GitHub, but the commits could be improved to have smaller changes more often to make the description clearer. The commits could also link to the user stories that were completed.

##### Sprint Retrospective

* Continue: Pace, I didn't overload myself on work so I am not behind on tasks.
* Continue: I should continue with the pace of work and work load for now.
* Start: I can start timeboxing my tasks to improve my time management.
* Start: I can start committing work more often.
* Due to the data tests in the morning, sprint 1 was shorter than other days so I can add more user stories to my sprint backlog for tomorrow.
